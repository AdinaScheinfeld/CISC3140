Hi, my name is Adina Scheinfeld. I am a graduating Senior majoring in in Computer Science with a double minor in Math and Data Science. Next semester, I am hoping to begin a PhD program in either Data Science or Computer Science. Specifically, I am interested in doing research in Data Science and Machine Learning. I have already applied to a number of PhD  programs, and I am waiting for responses. Any advice on where to apply or how to strengthen my application would be very much appreciated. 

One of my hobbies is exercising. I am a figure skater, and besides skating, I enjoy any exercise that will improve my skating skills.
